Picking a hosting site is important, things to consider include:
- space and bandwidth
- Domain name service
- reliability
- cost 
- customer service

When hosting at a third party site, it is important to use file transfer apps like **Filezilla** to send the files to directory being served like:
- www
- htdocs
- public_html

Unless specific routing is done, folder structures map directly to navigation in the site.

index.html is the default page in a directory and as the name suggests, a good index.html file is a gateway to the rest of the site
