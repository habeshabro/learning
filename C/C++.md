## C Language

C is a general purpose, "high level" language. It is easy to learn and highly structured. It is fast as it runs almost as fast as assembly code. It can handle a lot of low level processes. It can be used to make OSs(like it was originally designed to do in the case of UNIX systems), assemblers, compilers, etc...

## C Language Structure

- Preprocessor Commands
- Functions
- Variables
- Statements and Expressions
- Comments

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
	/* first c program */
	printf("Hello world \n");
	return 0;
}
```

- First line is a preprocessor command that tells the compiler to include studio.h file before actual compilation begins
- int main() is the main function where program execution begins

## Program Compilation and Execution

```bash
gcc hello.c
./a.out
```
